# DownTimer Docs

**When your phone or PC timer is not enough.**

Since DownTimer CLI is closed-source at the moment (in the future this will change to open-source), this repository is for:

- [releases](https://github.com/govisit/DownTimer-docs/releases)
- changelog (Coming soon)
- [documentation](https://github.com/govisit/DownTimer-docs/wiki) (in form of a wiki)
- [issues](https://github.com/govisit/DownTimer-docs/issues) for bugs and features
- [project planning](https://github.com/govisit/DownTimer-docs/projects)
