# DownTimer Docs

**When your phone or PC timer is not enough.**

Since DownTimer CLI is closed-source at the moment (in the future this will change to open-source), this repository is for:

- [releases](https://github.com/govisit/DownTimer-docs/releases) - download [latest](https://github.com/govisit/DownTimer-docs/releases/latest)
- changelog - (Coming soon)
- [documentation](https://github.com/govisit/DownTimer-docs/wiki) - in form of a wiki
- [issues](https://github.com/govisit/DownTimer-docs/issues) - for bugs and features
- [project planning](https://github.com/govisit/DownTimer-docs/projects)

> Linux binary works as expected, but binaries for Windows and MacOS (both versions), maybe do not work. If the binary does not work for you, feel free to open a issue.
