# DownTimer Docs

**When your phone or PC timer is not enough.**

Since DownTimer CLI is closed-source at the moment (in the future this will change to open-source), this repository is for:

- releases, changelog, and assets (download)
- documentation (in form of a wiki)
- issues for bugs and features
- project planning
